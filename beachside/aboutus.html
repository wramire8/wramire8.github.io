                    <h3>San Francisco's Local Cafe By the Beach</h3>
                    <p><br>
                        Patrick & Buffy Maguire's Beachside Coffee Bar & Kitchen is home to San Francisco natives, neighborhood residents, surfers, adventurers, families, and tourists all around. The inpiration to their cafe is dedicated to the community who enjoy a simple and lovely brunch near the beach with locally sourced and handcrafted foods while enjoying the Californian cozy ambiance. Beachside welcomes a nice roasted cup of coffee for both weather changes lately, from warming up from the chilly roll-in fog near the beach to the occasional bright and sunny days within the city. It's a nice little reminder there is a feeling of comfort near by.

                    <h3>A Message from the Owner's, <br> Patrick & Buffy Maguire</h3>
                    <p><br>
                        "We, the owners of the Java Cafes are also the pink cafe in the Outer Sunset where we serve our handcrafted fare and coffee from Lady Falcon Coffee Club. Our goal is to welcome all who enjoy a simple experience in locally sourced coffee & handcrafted foods for everyone to appreciate."

                    <h3>Thrillist Food's Appreciation Comment from Thrillist's Column, "The 22 Best Breakfast Spots in America" List</h3><br>

                    <p>
                        "If you knew nothing of San Francisco, and just spent an entire day in the Ocean Beach neighborhood, you would come away thinking that SF is not all that different from its more beach-focused Southern counterparts. The hood (which obviously sits right across the Great Highway from the actual Ocean Beach) is more of a surfer's enclave, more laid back and less bustling than the rest of the city, and offers some (relatively) undiscovered gems, Java Beach owners' Patrick and Buffy Maguire's Beachside Coffee Bar being one of them. Though they keep the same exacting standards with the coffee that they do at Java Beach, it's the food here that shines, from the fantastic Irish Breakfast Sandwich to our personal favorite, the fried chicken and waffle, with their bacon-in-the-batter-waffle substituted in."

                    <h3>Daily Coffee News Interview from Roast Magazine "Buffy Maguire's Lady Falcon Coffee Club Rides a Sea Breeze in San Francisco"</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        "...Maguire has been roasting for them all, confident that if a customer couldn't find what they wanted in one spot, the other was so close by, she was still covering all the bases. "I wanted to offer my neighbors, my family, my friends, our neighborhood - I wanted to offer them some choices," Maguire, who was born and raised in San Francisco's Sunset District, told Daily Coffee News. "They complement each other really well, and I was giving my neighbors different options."

                    <p>
                        "When her first cafe opened by the beach almost 25 years ago, there weren't nearly as many choices for coffee. She decided to change that, and now appreciates the wider variety of coffee shops tucked into corners and here there. Said Maguire, "A diversity of choices gives people a lot of freedom."
